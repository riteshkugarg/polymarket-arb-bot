Arbitrage Scanner & Atomic Executor

Implements mathematical combinatorial arbitrage detection and execution.

Core Concepts:
──────────────
ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY: Market inefficiency where sum of YES prices across
all outcomes < 0.98 (accounting for 1.5% taker fee buffer), allowing
risk-free profit by buying all outcomes.

ATOMIC EXECUTION: All-or-nothing execution model. Every leg of the arbitrage
must fill (FOK) without exceeding $0.005 slippage per outcome, or the entire
sequence is aborted to prevent being "legged in" (holding losing positions).

NEGRISK HANDLING: Markets where the conditional outcome is the ABSENCE of
an event (e.g., "Will candidate X lose?"). Normalized by computing the
"short the field" cost (buy NO on all outcomes) which equals 1.0 - sum(YES).

BUDGET MANAGEMENT: Maximize $100 total budget. Each arbitrage basket costs
$5-$10 to execute (number of outcomes × per-outcome cost).

MATHEMATICAL FORMULA:
═════════════════════

For multi-outcome market (e.g., 3 outcomes):
  sum_yes = price_outcome1 + price_outcome2 + price_outcome3
  
  If sum_yes < 0.98:
    arbitrage_profit_per_share = 1.0 - sum_yes (at maturity)
    
  Cost per share = sum_yes
  Shares_to_buy = min(budget_remaining / sum_yes, order_book_depth)
  
  Gross Profit = Shares * (1.0 - sum_yes)
  Net Profit = Gross_Profit - Taker_Fee (1.5% per trade × num_outcomes)

For NegRisk markets (inverse markets):
  short_field_cost = 1.0 - sum_yes  (cost to hedge all outcomes)
  normalized_entry = min(sum_yes, short_field_cost)

EXECUTION CONSTRAINTS:
══════════════════════
1. FOK (Fill-or-Kill): Each order must fill completely or be rejected
2. Slippage: No individual leg can exceed $0.005 slippage
3. Depth: Order book must support 10+ shares at target price
4. Balance: Must have sufficient USDC for entire basket upfront
5. Abort: If any leg fails, cancel all pending legs immediately
